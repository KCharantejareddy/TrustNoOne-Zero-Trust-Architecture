# TrustNoOne: Zero Trust Architecture Mini Project

This project demonstrates the implementation of Zero Trust security principles.
No user or device is trusted by default.

## Key Concepts Used
- Identity verification
- Device validation
- Role-based access control
- Continuous authentication

## Access Flow
1. User logs in with credentials
2. Device ID is verified
3. Requested action is checked against RBAC policies
4. Access is allowed or denied

## Technologies
- Python
- Security principles (Zero Trust)
